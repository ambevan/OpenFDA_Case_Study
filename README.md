This is a case study of the OpenFDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) by Antonia Bevan.


The repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:

1.  'Exploring_OpenFDA_Adverse_Reactions.ipynb' : a summary exploration of the entire FAERS database

2.  'Severity of adverse reactions in children.ipynb' : a more detailed investigation into a subset of the database composed of 5000 records of pediatric data

It also contains three python modules ('collect_data.py', 'clean_data.py' and 'process_data.py') which are used by these notebooks.

It additionally contains a file 'method_notes.pdf' which, in very brief and informal terms, describes the approach that I took. This file was created primarily for my own reference throughout the task but I include it here for reference.
